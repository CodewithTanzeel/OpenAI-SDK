            "Recursion, in its simplest form, is a programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition. Think of it like a set of Russian nesting dolls (Matryoshka dolls). Each doll contains a smaller version of itself, until you reach the smallest one.  In programming, each function call solves a smaller subproblem of the original problem, until you reach a base case (the smallest doll), which can be solved directly.\n",

            "1.  **Base Case (Stopping Condition):**  This is the most crucial part of recursion.  It's the condition that tells the function when to *stop* calling itself.  Without a base case, a recursive function would call itself infinitely, leading to a stack overflow error (more on that later).\n",
            "\n",

            "3.  **Call Stack:** When a function is called, the program stores information about that call (local variables, return address, etc.) on a stack called the call stack.  Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack.  Once the base case is reached, the function calls start returning, and the stack is unwound.\n",
